# Personal configuration files

These files that live in my home directory. They should be common to many linux
distributions.

Note what isn't included (yet) in this repository is some vim configuration. In
other similar setups, I have the following git submodules include in
`.gitconfig`:

```
[submodule "dot_vim/pack/themes/opt/solarized8"]
    path = dot_vim/pack/themes/opt/solarized8
    url = https://github.com/lifepillar/vim-solarized8.git
[submodule "dot_vim/pack/typescript/start/typescript-vim"]
    path = dot_vim/pack/typescript/start/typescript-vim
    url = https://github.com/leafgarland/typescript-vim.git
```

I've not included this here (yet) because I want to ensure it works properly on
non-linux platforms.
