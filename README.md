# Personal Linux configuration files

These files live in my home directory. They should be common to many Linux
distributions. Files follow the XDG convention, so that the `config` directory
is symbolically linked to `.config`, and most applications just work and pick up
their configuration from these locations. Some files are ignored because they
contain personal information or should otherwise not be tracked.
