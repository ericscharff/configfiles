# Personal Linux configuration files

These files live in my home directory. They should be common to many Linux
distributions. Files like `dot.tmux.conf` should be renamed to `.tmux.conf`for
actual use.

Also included are instructions on system maintenance.

Please be aware that these files are extermely out of date, and may not work on more
recent distributions.
